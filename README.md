### Hi everyone, I’m Jimmie Jonasson

### About me
Before I started studying Computer Science at Stockholm University I worked as freelance actor and director for over ten years. Originally I'm from Gotland, the biggest island in Sweden, but now I live in Stockholm.

### Learning
I´m a real sucker for learning. And it feels like I´m in constant learning mode. So much exciting things to learn. 
After two years with Java in school I´m now started learning Python.

### Productivity
After years with no system. Some time with GTD, Omnifocus and Todolists, I´m now trying out Personal Kanban, I´ve just started but I feel how I get so much done.
